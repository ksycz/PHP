<!-- In this task you need to take a userâ€™s credit card input and test if it is a valid credit card number.
Design a simple form to allow the user to input a credit card number (some test numbers are provided
below).
Test if the credit card number is valid.
Output an appropriate message, just showing the last 4 digits.
e.g.
Your credit card number ending in 1234 is valid
Your credit card number ending in 1234 is invalid
Replace 1234 with the last 4 digits of their input.

Step 1: Take the credit card number from the user input
4417123456789113
Step 2: Reverse the credit card number
3119876543217144
Step 3: Take each of the odd position digits and add them
3119876543217144
3 + 1 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 7 + 4 = 35
Step 4: Take each of the even digits and multiply by 2
3119876543217144
1*2=2 9*2=18 7*2=14 5*2=10 3*2=6 1*2 1*2 4*2
If the resulting answer for each digit is greater than 9 then subtract 9 from the answer and
then add the numbers together
2 + 9 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 8 = 35
Step 5: Add the totals from Step 3 and Step 4
35 + 35 = 70
Step 6: Take the total from Step 5 and check if it divisible by 10 (with no remainder). If it is then the
card number is valid.
